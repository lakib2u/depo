Simple interest is calculated as principal * rate * time.\
 To find the interest amount after 50 days for a daily deposit of $50 with a daily interest rate of 5%,
 you can use the following formula:

principal = 50
rate = 5 / 100 / 365 (convert annual interest rate to daily interest rate)
time = 50

simple_interest = principal * rate * time

simple_interest = 50 * (5 / 100 / 365) * 50 = 0.25 * 50 = 12.5

Simple interest is calculated as principal * rate * time. 
To find the interest amount after 2 months for a daily deposit of $50 with a monthly interest rate of 5%,
 you can use the following formula:

principal = 50
rate = 5 / 100 / 12 (convert annual interest rate to monthly interest rate)
time = 2

simple_interest = principal * rate * time

simple_interest = 50 * (5 / 100 / 12) * 2 = 0.4167 * 2 = 0.83

How Does Simple Interest Calculators work?
The simple interest calculator will show the accrued amount that includes both principal and the interest. The simple interest calculator works on the mathematical formula:

A = P (1+rt)

P = Principal Amount
R = Rate of interest
t = Number of years
A = Total accrued amount (Both principal and the interest)

Interest = A – P.

Let’s understand the workings of the simple interest calculator with an example. The principal amount is Rs 10,000, the rate of interest is 10% and the number of years is six. You can calculate the simple interest as:

A = 10,000 (1+0.1*6) = Rs 16,000.

Interest = A – P = 16000 – 10000 = Rs 6,000.
